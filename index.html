    <h2>How to Use This</h2>
    <p>Using Text to Code Translator is simple. Just type the name of the HTML 
        element you want to create, like "box," "circle," "line," or "iframe," 
        in the input field and click "Translate Text." The tool will generate 
        the corresponding HTML and CSS code for you. You can also edit the 
        generated code to customize the appearance and behavior of your elements.</p>

    <h2>Why Use This?</h2>
    <p>This tool was developed to fast-track coding for beginners. It simplifies the process of creating
         HTML and CSS code, making it easier for newcomers to web development to 
         get started. You can use this tool to quickly generate code for common 
         HTML elements like boxes, circles, lines, iframes, headings, and more. 
         It's a great way to learn and experiment with coding without the need 
         for in-depth web programming knowledge.</p>
    
   
    
    <h2>HTML and CSS Intro</h2>
    <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language for 
        creating web pages. It uses tags to structure the content on a 
        web page. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control the 
        presentation and layout of HTML elements. CSS rules, like specifying colors, 
        sizes, and positions, are defined in curly braces within a stylesheet.</p>
    
    <h2>What's Coming in the Future</h2>
    <p>In the near future, we are working on enhancing this tool to accept 
        multiple input characters and integrating it with AI models like Chat GPT. 
        This will enable features like autocorrection, autosuggestions, parsing, 
        and assisting users in creating code even if they've never coded before. 
        Our goal is to make web development more accessible and flexible, bridging 
        the gap between coding and visual design with drag-and-drop site builders.</p>
    
    <h2>Getting Started with CSS</h2>
    <p>If you're new to CSS, you can start by adjusting different properties 
        to see how they affect your web elements. For example, try changing 
        the <code>background-color</code>, <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, 
        <code>border-radius</code>, and <code>color</code> properties to experiment 
        with design changes. You'll quickly learn how CSS can transform the look and 
        feel of your web pages.</p>
